# Magic the Gather personal Card Database   

## This is a personal project to try a few different things that I don't touch in my day to day life

Magic the gather has always been an interest to me and trying to catalog / database my cards has always been frustrating. This is something I would like to save by building an image recognition application to automatically register my cards in bulk. 

### Goals: 
- Bulk image processing on cards
- Simple frontend to access your card details and information
- Database backend on Postgres
- Simple login service

### Reaching Goals:
- Microservice application deployment of the frontend application
- Save to cloud service 
- Make it looks nice
